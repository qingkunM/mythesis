  Abstract                 = {We propose an approach that combines symbolic execution and run-time type inference from a sample program run to generate test cases, and we apply our approach to signed/unsigned conversion errors in programs. A signed/unsigned conversion error occurs when a program makes control flow decisions about a value based on treating it as a signed integer, but then later converts the value to an unsigned integer in a way that breaks the program's implicit assumptions. Our tool follows the approach of Larson and Austin in using an example input to pick a program path for analysis, and we use symbolic
execution to attempt synthesis of a program input exhibiting an error. We describe a proof of concept implementation that uses the Valgrind binary analysis framework and the STP decision procedure, and we report on preliminary experiences. Our implementation is available at http://www.sf.net/projects/catchconv .},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Pex automatically produces a small test suite with high code coverage for a
 .NET program. To this end, Pex performs a systematic program analysis (using
 dynamic symbolic execution, similar to path-bounded model-checking) to determine
 test inputs for Parameterized Unit Tests. Pex learns the program behavior by
 monitoring execution traces. Pex uses a constraint solver to produce new test
 inputs which exercise different program behavior. The result is an automatically
 generated small test suite which often achieves high code coverage. In one case
 study, we applied Pex to a core component of the .NET runtime which had already
 been extensively tested over several years. Pex found errors, including a serious
 issue.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Windows操作系统作为目前全球使用最广泛的桌面操作系统,一旦其漏洞被利用将造成严重后果,所以对Windows操作系统的漏洞发掘意义重大。当前对软件安全漏洞的发现更多的是依靠安全研究人员的经验和运气,缺乏系统且有效的方法指导。为了找到一种能够快速发现Windows一类漏洞的方法,本文从安全补丁的修补方法入手,分析了漏洞补丁后可能引入新的安全隐患的4种模式,提出了一种参考安全补丁比对的软件安全漏洞挖掘方法,并对方法进行了形式化描述。利用此方法较好的解决了半自动化挖掘Windows系统漏洞问题。最后以Windows操作系统未知漏洞案例验证了该方法的有效性},
